## General info

This project is an escape game, for the city of Mulhouse in France. The goal is to discver the city and its history,
while playing mini-games. The game is played on a mobile phone, and the player has to go to the different locations to
launch the mini-games.

The website is made with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.
